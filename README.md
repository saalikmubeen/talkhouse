# talkhouse

WebRTC based peer to peer video calling and messaging web app build with MERN stack.

# [Demo](https://talkhouse-tv.netlify.app/)

# Libraries used

- **`React`** for frontend
- **`Socket.io`** as signaling server and realtime communication
- **`simple-peer`** for peer-to-peer WebRTC connections
- **`Express`** as server
- **`MongoDB`** for persistance of data
- **`Material UI`** for creating ui
- **`Redux`** for state management
- **`Typescript`** for type safety, cure for headache you get when props are flowing all over the app with no hint

# Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Audio and Video Chat
- Messaging with storage of messages in the database
- Sending invitation to friends
- Able to accept or reject an invitation
- Online indicator
- Notify on typing
- Sceen sharing
- Accept and reject an incoming call

**and more....**

## New Features added recently

- **`Group Chats`** Create group chats like in whats'app. Group Admins can add members to group and participants can leave the group.
- Remove friend, ability to unfriend someone
- **`Talkhouse Spaces`** like Twitter spaces. You can host a space and any of your friends can join that space.
- **`Push Notifications`** for incoming calls, messages and friend requests.

The **talkhouse spaces** are implemented using MESH topology to establish a peer-to-peer network between every person or client joining the space.
i.e, every person maintains a p2p connection with every other person in the room.

# TODOS

- [x]  Enable group video and messaging functionality
- [x]  Implement Push Notifications and make it a PWA
- [ ]  Implement confirm email, reset password and email sending on friend invitation, *Not a big deal to implement, just a little lazy to implement it*
- [ ]  Store messages in an encrypted form in the database. (Just wrote it for fun. I mean is it even worth to do it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- [x]  Enhace the UI. I hate CSS, not that good at it ü•±üòì . (Looks reasonably good now)
